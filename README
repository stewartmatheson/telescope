== Welcome to Telescope

Telescope is a forums application that does not have forums. Posts with in Telescope are made in the wide yonder. In the place of forums is a sophisticated search engine that remains persistent accross the wider user base.

Due to the this Telescope requires Sphinx to be installed. Here is the configure line that was used to install Sphinx during development. 

   ./configure --with-mysql-libs=/usr/local/mysql/lib
   
If your running linux then you should be able to install Sphinx via your package management system. I think there is also a version available on MacPorts but its old so I did not bother with it.

Sphinx its self requires epatXML and iconv. Both are avaiable to download from locations that will surly turn up with a google search :).  I can confirm that Sphinx 0.9.8 complies with iconv version 1.12 and epatXML 2.0.1
